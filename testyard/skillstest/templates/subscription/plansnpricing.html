                            <h4>How much does "Unlimited Plan" really cost?</h4>
                            <p>The cost of "Unlimited Plan" depends on your usage of the resources allocated for your exclusive TestYard instance. It consists of a one-time fixed cost which includes creating a host system on the AWS Cloud, creating an elastic IP address for use with the created host, creation of a CA signed security certificate, and various other bits and bobs that happen behind the scene during deployment of the TestYard service instance. The monthly bill is a function of how much the TestYard service is accessed by you and your users (and not on how many tests and/or interviews you create or schedule).</p>

                            <p>Yes, you can certainly cancel your subscription any time you want. Once you do that, you will not be billed from the next billing cycle (i.e., from the next month onwards). However, since you have already availed the service partially during the current month, we will need to bill you for that. We would have already allocated resources for your exclusive use in the current month, and that means our service providers will bill us for the entire month. Thus we really do not have the choice of waiving your bill for the current month.<br/>In order to cancel your subscription, please visit your <a href="/skillstest/subscriptions/dashboard/">Subscription Dashboard</a> page and click the "Cancel Subscription" button at the top of the right panel. It would lead you through the process of cancellation of your subscription.</p>

                            <h4>What happens to my data after I discontinue my subscription?</h4>
                            <p>Once you discontinue your subscription, either by cancelling it explicitly, or by not renewing it by paying the monthly bill, we will archive your data for a period of 60 days. If you change your mind and return back to the platform by subscribing again, you will be able to access your old data from your previous subscription. Once this period of 60 days are over, we will need to purge your data. The reason for this is that there is a limit to the amount of resources that we access to (from our service providers) and hence we need to make room for our existing subscribers at all costs. However, if you subscribe to our "Business Plan", you will have the option to download your tests and interviews data in CSV and XML formats. If you do that and return to our platform at some later time with that data, you would be able to restore it and use it as before. </p>
                            <p>Please keep in mind that the data you generate by creating tests and interviews is owned by you and keeping it available on the platform is your responsibility. TestYard has the right to use your data for statistical purposes only. However, since this data occupies space on our data storage facility, it has to be purged if it is not paid for by you. <u>That is why we need to purge the data after your subscription ends, unless you renew your subscription.</u></p>

                            <h4>Who can see my tests and interviews data?</h4>
                            <p> It depends on the value of "visibility" of your test or interview. If you are a creator of the concerned test, then click on the "Tests & Interviews" menu item from the navigation menu at the top and view the tabular data in the "Tests as Creator" tab. There is a column named "Visibility", and it is the fourth column from the right. You can set the visibility of the test by selecting one of the options. If you select "Private", your test would not be visible to anyone except the candidates who you invite to take the test. If you select "Protected", the test will be visible to users who are listed as your "Connections", apart from any user who is invited to take the test (You can find out your list of connections from the "Network" page, at the bottom of the right panel). Interviews created by you are always private, and no one can view them, except for candidates who attend the interview. Tests evaluated by you are private only if the creator of the test sets the visibility to "Private". You do not have control over tests that are not created by you. If you are a candidate in a test and you wish to keep it private, you may do so by selecting "Private" in the visibility column of the tabular display in "Tests as Candidate" tab. The default value for visibility of tests, both as creator and as candidate, is Public. However, you may set the visibility as Private while creating a test too. </p>

                            <p>The tests and interviews data that you create on the TestYard platform are kept for a period of 60 days after your subscription ends. The subscription can be terminated either by you (if you specifically terminate it) or by the TestYard platform (could be because of non-payment of dues or end of subscription period or because of non-adherance to the platform's policies). Once the post subscription 60 days period ends, all data created by you is liable to be purged. This includes tests and interviews created by you during the subscription period, groups created by you during the subscription period, and messages sent by you during subscription period. However, your posts to groups owned by other users or messages to other users would remain. But if you renew your subscription after the said period of 60 days, there is no guarantee that such messages would be visible to you. However, if you had subscribed to our "Business Plan" and downloaded your data as csv or xml, then you would be able to restore that data again, if you renewed your "Business Plan" subscription. Please bear in mind that the data you generate by creating tests and interviews is owned by you and keeping it available on the platform is your responsibility. TestYard reserves the right to use your data for statistical purposes only. However, since this data occupies space on our data storage facility, it has to be purged if it is not paid for by you.

Once this period lapses, your data would be purged. Hence, renewal of your subscription after this 60 day period would result in losing the data you created on the platform. </p>
                            <p><a id="paidgroups" style="font-weight:bold;">Paid Groups:</a> A paid group is one for which members pay to join in. This payment could be either i) an entry fee or ii) a subscription on a monthly basis. It can't be both, though. You can create such groups by specifying payment process related information like certain bank account details, payment processor details, etc. You can create such a group by clicking on the "Create a group" button in the Network section of this website. In the "Create a Group" screen that appears, add the requisite information for creating a group, and check the "Is Paid" checkbox. This will display the fields pertaining to paid groups and you would need to add this information. Once such a group is created, users can join it by paying the specified amount. How users pay is upto you - you may go for an entry fee based group of a monthly subscription based group. Please bear in mind that if you choose to specify "RazorPay" as the Payment Processor, then you would need to specify GSTIN also. The RazorPay option is specifically for Indian citizens only, and without a GSTIN you would not be able to use RazorPay as your Payment Processor.</p>
