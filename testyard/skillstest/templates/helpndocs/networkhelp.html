<h3> Network Page</h3>
<p style='color:#505050;'>
Generally, the Network page allows you to create coherent groups so that you may provide tests, interviews and information pertaining to a group in an effective way. For example, if you are an educator, and you have a group of students learning some skill from you, you can create a group containing all your students and give them tests and interviews as a coherent unit. You may create groups that require your students to pay you a fee (either one time or as a subscription for a given period, usually a month) if and when they join it. That way, you earn from the efforts put up by you on TestYard. Of course, you may have free groups too, which anyone can join (depending either on an approval from you, the creator of the group, or without any approval). This page will take you through each activity provided on the Network page, and help you relate to it in a meaningful way.
</p>
<p style='color:#505050;'>
The Network Page allows you to perform the listed activities:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><a href="#creategroup">Create a Group</a></li>
<li><a href="#joingroup">Join a Group</a></li>
<li><a href="#addcontact">Add a Contact</a></li>
<li><a href="#postmessage">Post a message in a Group</a></li>
<li><a href="#manageownedgroups">Manage Owned Groups</a></li>
<li><a href="#givetesttogroup">Give a Test to one or more Groups</a></li>
</ul>
<br/>
Additionally, in the right panel, you may:
<ul>
<li><a href="#groupssubscribed">click on the groups subscribed by you,</a></li><li><a href="#checkemails">check your emails on the TestYard platform</a>,</li> <li><a href="#invitationsreceived">act on invitations received to connect with other members</a>,</li> <li>or <a href="#viewprofiles">simply browse the profiles of your connections on the platform.</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p style='color:#505050;'>
<b><a id="creategroup">Create a Group</a></b>: This feature allows you to create a group. As mentioned above, your created group may or may not be a paid one. If it is a paid group, you would be asked for some financial information (as listed below). If not, you simply need to provide us with the very basic information for creating a group. Please note that the group thus created will be an empty one. You would need to ask your students
(or candidates, as the case may be) to join the newly created group. <i>Every member of a group needs to be a bonafide user on TestYard platform.</i> To invite them to join your group, you may use TestYard's mail service to send them a request to join.
</p>
<p style='color:#505050;'>
The following information is needed to create a group.
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><b>Group Name</b> - This could be anything that is meaningful to you. Please restrict yourself to alphanumeric characters only.</li>
<li><b>Tagline</b> - A oneliner that provides the essence of the group.</li>
<li><b>Description</b> - Anything that describes the group. Please be brief though.</li>
<li><b>Group Topic</b> - The topic under which this group can be clubbed.</li>
<li><b>Is Paid</b> - Whether this is a paid group or not. If you select this, you will be shown a further list of fields. More on them below.</li>
<li><b>Group Type</b> - The visibility of the group. Public groups are visible to everyone (but non-members cannot view group's posts). Private groups are visible only to members and owner of the group. Hidden groups are, well, hidden. You might want to hide a group if you don't want anyone to know the existence of such a group.</li>
<li><b>Active</b> - Whether the group is in active state or not.</li>
<li><b>Allow Entry</b> - Leave this selected if you want users to join this group.</li>
<li><b>Max Members Allowed</b> - The maximum number of members the group is allowed to have. We thought 10000 would be good enough, but change as you please.</li>
<li>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
Paid Groups: You need to enter the following additional information for Paid groups:
<li><b>Bank Name</b> - Indian users may select the name of their bank. Non-Indian users may select PayPal or Wise</li>
<li><b>Branch</b> - Enter the name of the bank's branch where your account is. Users selecting PayPal or Wise should leave this empty.</li>
<li><b>IFSCode</b> - Enter your bank's IFSCode. This officially ties you with the branch of the bank. Users selecting PayPal or Wise should leave this empty.</li>
<li><b>Name in Account</b> - Please enter the account holder's name. For PayPal or Wise users, this should be your username in PayPal or Wise.</li>
<li><b>Account Number</b> - Enter the identifier number of your bank account. PayPal users should leave this empty. Wise users need to enter the account number of their account on Wise</li>
<li><b>Payment Type</b> - Enter the payment scheme you want to use for your users. It may be only one of "Entry Fee Based" or "Subscription Based"</li>
<li><b>Entry Fee</b> - Enter the entry fee amount (in US$) if you selected "Entry Fee Based".</li>
<li><b>Subscription Fee</b> - Enter the subscription fee amount (in US$) if you selected "Subscription Based".</li>
<li><b>Subscription Period</b> - Enter the subscription period (in days) for which the Subscription Fee amount may be paid.</li>
<li><b>GSTIN</b> - Indian users may enter their GSTIN number. Users who selected PayPal or Wise as Bank name should leave this empty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Click on the "Create Group" button to complete the process.

<p style='color:#505050;'>
<b><a id="joingroup">Join a Group:</a></b> This feature allows you to join a group as a member. This might involve a financial transaction, should the group you are trying to join is a paid one. In order to join a group, first you need to search and retrieve the group using the search feature on the screen.
</p>
<p style='color:#505050;'>
Once you find the group you are looking for, click on the link to the group. This should open up a screen containing the basic details of the group, and at the bottom of it you will find the "Join" button. If the group is a paid one, clicking on "Join" would take you through a payment gateway, where you would need to make the requisite payment. Once that completes successfully, you are good.
</p>
<p style='color:#505050;'>
Some groups require the group's owner to approve your join request. This could take some time depending on the availability of the group's owner. Once your join request to such a group has been sent, you can revisit this screen later and send a reminder to the owner using the "Send Gentle Reminder" button. 
</p>
<p style='color:#505050;'>
To know more about a group, you may click the "Open Group Page" button to view some specific details of the group. To exit the screen, click the "Close" button.
</p>
<p style='color:#505050;'>
<b><a id="addcontact">Add a Contact:</a></b> This feature allows you to look up any user based on the user's username on the TestYard platform or the email Id of the user. Once the user is found, you may send the user a "Connection Request" by clicking on the "Send Connect Request" button. Once the targetted user approves of this connection request, you become connected with that user on the TestYard platform, and you may exchange notes with that user through the TestYard platform.
</p>
<p style='color:#505050;'>
In case of a rejection of a connection request, you will be duly notified about it through the TestYard email messaging service discussed below.
</p>
<p style='color:#505050;'>
You may view the publicly available information pertaining to the user without connecting too. This information would include tests and interviews data that have a "public" visibility. You can do this by clicking on the username part of the users that your search yielded. The motivation behind this feature is to allow prospective employers/teachers view the strengths and weaknesses of any user on TestYard, and thus make an informed decision (regarding recruiting or training). Note: <i>Misuse of such information may lead to criminal proceedings. Please use this feature with requisite prudence.</i>
</p>
<p style='color:#505050;'>
<b><a id="postmessage">Post a message in a Group:</a></b> This screen allows you to post a message to a group's wall, or to specific user(s) (you need to be registered as a "connection" to the targetted user(s)), or to a set of users who has taken a test created by you. This would allow for open communication channel between a test owner/creator and test candidates, and between a user and a group the user is subscribed to. Please be nice to other users and subscribers of the groups. Note: <i>Misuse and/or abuse of such channels may lead to criminal proceedings and may force the administrators of the TestYard platform to ban the offending user altogether. Please use this feature with requisite prudence.</i>
</p>
<p style='color:#505050;'>
Apart from posting messages, you may also send files (<5.0MB). This would enable you to share content associated with the message you are trying to post.
</p>
<p style='color:#505050;'>
<b><a id="manageownedgroups">Manage Owned Groups:</a></b> This screen enables you to manage groups created by you (the user) and allows you change certain aspects of the group. Each of the groups listed on this screen contains 3 buttons at the extreme right side of the tabular display - "Save Info", "Settings and Join Requests" and "Manage Posts". The "Save Info" button allows you to save the changes you make to the group on this screen. The "Settings and Join Requests" button opens an overlay screen that contains 3 links at the left hand side - "Settings", "Join Requests" and "Group Posts". Clicking on the "Settings" button opens up a section that contains the settings for the group. Among other things, it contains data pertaining to monetization information in case of paid groups. You would be able to modify details should you need to from this screen.
</p>
<p style='color:#505050;'>
The other 2 links (Join Requests and Group Posts) are self explanatory. You can join in a discussion in group posts from this screen.<br/>
The "Join Requests" screen allows you to view join requests from users who wish to be members of the group. You may leave the requests "Open", or take an action listed in the dropdown. Finally, you need to save the changes by clicking on the "Save" button beside each join request.<br/>
Group posts may be moderated using the screen opened by clicking on the "Manage Posts" button on the "Manage Owned Groups" screen. You may hide certain posts if you consider them inappropriate.<br/>
Additionally, this screen also allows you to search for groups you want to modify, which should be very handy in case you have created a lot of groups and the list doesn't fit in a single page.
</p>
<p style='color:#505050;'>
<b><a id="givetesttogroup">Give a test to one or more Groups:</a></b> This screen allows you to send a selected test to one or more groups listed in the dropdown below. To send the selected test to one or more groups, select the groups from the dropdown, and click the "Send Test" button. The checkbox "Force Create New Test URL" should be left checked in order to create fresh test taking URLs for users. If this is unchecked, and you are sending a test to a user who has already been invited to take the same test at some point of time in the past, the application will use the same URL from the past invitation. This could be a problem if you have deactivated or cancelled that invitation. (Cancellation and deactivation of tests and interviews are discussed in the help pages for Tests and Interviews.)<br/>
The default values set in the TestYard service provides you with a hassle-free way to conduct, evaluate and take tests and interviews. So in case you are unsure of some input value, leave it with the default value.
</p>
<p style='color:#505050;'>
<b><a id="groupssubscribed">Groups Subscribed by You:</a></b> This screen is similar to the screen displayed when you click on "Settings and Join Requests" button in the "Manage Owned Groups" screen. The only difference is that the "Settings" link might be missing if you are not the owner of the group. <i>Group owners are members of the same group by default</i>. Hence, you will find all the groups owned by you in the list of Groups Subscribed by you. You would be able to join the discussions in the group from this screen.

</p>
<p style='color:#505050;'>
<b><a id="checkemails">Check TestYard Emails:</a></b> Clicking on the "Inbox" link near the bottom of the righthand panel will open up the inbox screen for emails. You may use this screen to search messages, view messages and reply to them. The messages that appear here are the message sent to you by other members using the "Post a Message" screen (discussed above). The TestYard messaging system only allows for messages to be sent to other TestYard members, and doesn't allow messages to be sent to external email addresses.<br/>
Actually, the messaging system is not a email messaging system (that is, it doesn't use the SMTP protocol to send messages). This is a system that provides a channel for messaging between users on the TestYard platform only.
</p>
<p style='color:#505050;'>
<b><a id="invitationsreceived">Connection Invitations Received:</a></b> You will find the list of connection invitations you have received in this section of the right panel. You would be able to accept or reject them from this feature. Once all connection invitations have been taken care of (either by accepting them or rejecting them), this list will be empty.
</p>
<p style='color:#505050;'>
<b><a id="viewprofiles">View Profiles of Connected Users:</a></b> Finally, at the very bottom of the right panel, you will find the list of users you have connected with on the TestYard platform. To view their profiles and their achievements in tests and interviews, you can simply click on the listed connection. This would open up an overlay screen listing the tests and interviews created, evaluated or taken by the connected user. This screen also offers a view of the groups owned and groups subscribed by the connected user as well as the list of connections of the connected user. This offers the user with a means to check out the skills and the interests of other users who are not connected directly.<br/>
Note: <i>Misuse and/or abuse of this feature may lead to criminal proceedings and would force the administrators of the TestYard platform to ban the offending user altogether. Please use this feature with requisite prudence.</i>
